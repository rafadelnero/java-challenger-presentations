/**
 * Make it work, make it better real soon
 * Imperative style: we tell what to do and also how to do it
 * Declarative style: we tell what to do and not how to do it
 * Cascading style sheet (CSS) - just tell how it works
 * Functional style: declarative style + higher order functions
 *
 * higher-order functions:
 * we pass functions to functions
 * we create functions in functions
 * we return functions from functions
 *
 * Lazy Evaluations:
 * Functional programming relies on lazy evaluation for effiency
 * Lazy evaluation relies on purity of functions (immutability) for correctness
 * Correctness first - fundamentals to keep in mind
 *
 * Don't refactor any code without automated tests
 * Functional programming is hard when coming from the imperative style background
 * Pair programming is useful to break paradigms of how we used to do something
 * Rubber duck concept - try to explain the problem to the duck
 *
 * Think declarative before thinking functional
 * Ask what the code do, instead of how you will solve the problem
 *
 * Think along the lines of transformation of data
